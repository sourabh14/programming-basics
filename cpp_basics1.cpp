/* ABOUT C++
	-Object-Oriented and compiled language - supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.
	-Middle-level language: can do both programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.)
	-Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
	-Pointer and direct Memory-Access: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address.
	-Rich library support

	-Applications 
		Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
		Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
		Graphics & Game engine

		Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method

		Static Variables: Static variables are also known as Class variables. They are declared using the static keyword within a class

		Dynamically allocated memory is allocated on Heap and non-static and local variables get memory allocated on Stack
